srmethod='default';        		%will pick j349 or muskingum-cunge based on input data table
%srmethod='j349';       			%dynamic j349/Livinston method - only pick one of two methods (comment other)
%srmethod='muskingum';   			%percent loss TL plus muskingum-cunge for travel time
j349fast=1;                          %1 for j349 reduces output written by j349, and also uses one single file for input/output, for use in deployment
j349multurf=0;                       %1 for j349 multiple urf method to do flow routing using variable celerity/dispersion (0 uses single celerity/dispersion for time series) 
inputfilename='StateTL_inputdata.csv'; %filename used for subreach input data - currently xlsx or csv/txt/dat delimited - if changing base name (ie for calibration), first load evap and stagedischarge from StateTL_inputdata.xlsx
datestart=2018;					%start for data and processing, may be full year or some period as year/mo/day; mo/day will be overriden by fullyear option = 1

fullyear=1;                          %overrides smaller period and uses year specified in date above but runs for full calendar year (plus 9 days spinup - ie 374 or 375 total days)
readinputfile=0;				%0,1,2 - 1 reads from inputfile and saves mat file; 2 reads but doesnt save (ie for calibration), otherwise reads mat file;
readstagedischarge=0;				%1 rereads stagedischarge data and also default methods; but if rereading subreach data dont have to reread (ie for calibration)
readevap=0;					%1 rereads evap; if evapnew=1 repulls locations using HBrest and evap for full time periods, must do if adding/modifing locations or wdids; but if rereading subreach data dont have to reread; 
pullstationdata=0;				%0,1,2 - read station (gage and telemetry based) flow data; 1 rebuilds and reads from REST, 2 only pull new/modified from REST, 3 loads from saved mat file
pulllongtermstationdata=0;			%1 reads daily station data from 2000 through previous year to establish dry/wet/avgs for filling; only runs if pullstationdata is 1 or 2
pullreleaserecs=0;				%0,1,2 - 0 load from saved mat file, 1 if want to repull all from REST(ie for new period), 2 if only pull new/modified from REST for same period
runriverloop=1;				    	%0,1,2 - 1 runs gageflow loop for full river amounts (ie not individual water classes), 2 won't save mat file, 0 uses mat file
runwcloop=0;					%0,1,2 - 1 runs water class release loop - have to have run river loop before (saved .mat file) or during, 2 won't save mat file, 0 uses mat file
doexchanges=0;					%1 run upstream exchanges - this only operates within wcloop
runcaptureloop=0;				%1 runs loop to characterize release capture amounts into headgates vs available amount, 0 wont run it
runcalibloop=0;					%1 runs loop to simulate river flows from gage amount at top of wd down without restarting each gage location with gage amount, 0 wont run it

copydatafiles=1;                     %1 copies datafiles from main matlab folder into command line specified folder (to avoid potential issues with multiple instances)
savefinalmatfile=0;                  %saves final file after capture or calibration loop, big and only need if want StateTLplot for cal after clearing
